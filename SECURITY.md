We appreciate your efforts to disclose your findings responsibly, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/VerteraIO/vertera/security/advisories/new) tab.

The Vertera team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial response to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress toward a fix and a full announcement and may request additional information or guidance.
The expected response time is within 3 business days, and the fix is expected to be delivered within 30 days.
